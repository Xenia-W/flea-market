> A DApp based on Nebulas.<br>
- This application is based on Nebulas net. I used the smart contract on Nebulas mainnet.

## To Run It

1.	You can build this project and deploy it on the server(such as Tomcat, Nginx...). 

2.	Install the WebExtensionWallet on your chrome browser, see details [here](https://github.com/ChengOrangeJu/WebExtensionWallet).

3.	Open the url in your chrome browser, and you can use it now.

4.	P.S.: To use this DApp, you need a Nebulas wallet account on mainnet with any positive number of NAS.


## Build Setup

> A Vue.js project 

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
